This citation format includes:
- The name of the author(s), ensuring credit is given to those who contributed to the dataset.
- The publication year, situating the dataset within its correct temporal context.
- The descriptive title and version number, aiding in the identification and differentiation of this dataset.
- The resource type, marked as a [Data set], to distinguish it from other scholarly outputs.
- The hosting platform (GitHub Repository) and the location (URL) where the dataset can be accessed, providing a stable link for direct access.

By providing this recommended citation, I aim to promote a culture of recognition and respect within the research community, ensuring users have the necessary information for proper citation. This effort supports transparency, accountability, and the principles of open science.
