# Data Curation Final Project_LZ

## Introduction
This repository is developed for my final assignment in the LIS 545 Data Curation course, showcasing a practical application of data curation principles. The repository is based on the dataset used in Thorben Pelzer's research article "Enter the Pragmatic Engineer: Ling Hongxun at Jiaotong University, 1920–1927," published in History of Education. It includes replication data and supplemental geospatial data that were essential to the research.

## Dataset Contents
- `pelzer_pragmaticengineer_replication.R`: This R script file contains the code to replicate the statistical analyses from Pelzer’s study.
- `nanyang1926_streets.geojson`: Geospatial data for streets around the 1926 campus of Nanyang University.
- `nanyang1926_rivers.geojson`: Geospatial data for rivers in the vicinity of the 1926 Nanyang University campus.
- `nanyang1926_campusroads.geojson`: Geospatial data for roads within the 1926 Nanyang University campus.
- `nanyang1926_buildings.geojson`: Geospatial data for buildings on the 1926 Nanyang University campus.
- `MANIFEST.TXT`: A text file listing all the files contained in the dataset along with their checksums for verification purposes.

## Metadata
The dataset is accompanied by a metadata file named `pelzer_pragmaticengineer_metadata.xml`, structured according to the Dublin Core schema. This file provides detailed information about the dataset, including its title, creator, subject, description, publisher, contributor, publication date, data type, format, identifier, source, language, relation, geographical coverage, and rights. It enhances the dataset’s accessibility and facilitates its reuse in academic and research settings.
