# Data Curation Final Project_LZ
## Introduction
This repository is developed as part of my final assignment for the LIS 545 Data Curation class. It serves as a practical application of the concepts and skills I've learned throughout the course, including the use of GitHub, data management, metadata creation, data citation, data sharing, and long-term preservation. The "Comprehensive Dataset on East Asian Economic Indicators" is utilized as a scenario to practice these aspects. It contains key economic indicators for East Asian countries from 2016 to 2020, with a specific focus on annual GDP growth rates for China, Japan, and South Korea. This dataset not only provides a foundation for practicing data curation techniques but also aims to offer insights into the economic performance of these nations, contributing to academic discussions on economic trends in East Asia. Through this project, I aim to showcase my understanding and application of data curation principles, including effective data use, metadata standards, repository management, and the broader implications of data sharing and preservation in the academic landscape.
## Dataset Contents
- `Data_example.csv`: The primary data file containing annual GDP growth rates for China, Japan, and South Korea from 2016 to 2020. Each entry in the file represents a year and a country's GDP growth percentage, providing a clear overview of economic trends.
- `Metadata_example.xml`: An XML file structured according to the Dublin Core schema, this metadata file offers detailed information about the dataset, including its title, creators, subject keywords, and more. It ensures that the dataset is well-documented, promoting its discoverability and ease of use.
## Metadata
Accompanying the dataset, the `Metadata_example.xml` file is structured following the Dublin Core schema. It includes comprehensive details about the dataset, such as the title, creators, subject keywords, publication year, and format, enhancing the datasetâ€™s accessibility and facilitating its reuse in academic and research settings.
