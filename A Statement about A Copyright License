In selecting a copyright license for my dataset, I've given thorough consideration to how I wish my work to be used and shared within the academic community and beyond. My goal is to encourage the widest possible use, distribution, and further development of my data while ensuring that contributions are appropriately acknowledged. To achieve this balance, I have decided to license my dataset under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).
This decision was influenced by my commitment to open research and my desire to support and facilitate academic collaboration. The CC BY 4.0 license allows others to copy, distribute, remix, transform, and build upon the data, even commercially, as long as they credit me for the original creation. This level of openness not only maximizes the potential impact and utility of my work but also aligns with my principles of fostering a culture of transparency and cooperation in research.
By choosing the CC BY 4.0 license, I aim to remove barriers to data access and usage, contributing to a more inclusive and collaborative research environment. I believe that by making my dataset freely available and easily reusable, I can encourage innovation and knowledge sharing, leading to new insights and advancements in my field.
It's important to me that this dataset serves as a resource that can be built upon. I hope that by providing clear guidelines for attribution, the license will ensure that all contributors receive recognition for their work, fostering an ecosystem of mutual respect among researchers. Furthermore, this approach to licensing reflects my understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by digital data management and my dedication to the principles of open science.
